- 🔭 I worked a lot as a Linux/Cloud sysadmin but of all that I have touched, I prefer the qualification simply of Computer Scientist.
- 🌱 I developed solid knowledge in data analysis:

      However, the essential skill in this sector is not the tool but the knowledge of the business to analyze to obtain the best insights.

- 🌱 Python is my Swiss army knife. I use it for scripting, data analysis, data mining and for API service.
