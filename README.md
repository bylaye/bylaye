## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  it's  Abdoulaye ðŸ˜„

### - ðŸ”­ I worked a lot as a Linux/Cloud sysadmin but of all that I have touched, I prefer the qualification simply of Computer Scientist.


### - ðŸŒ± I developed solid knowledge in data analysis: My favorite tools remain: Python + SQL and Metabase or Grafana for visualization. However, the essential skill in this sector is not the tool but the knowledge of the business to analyze to obtain the best insights.

### - ðŸ¤” Python is my Swiss army knife. I use it for scripting, data analysis, data mining and for API service.


### - ðŸ’¬ ðŸ‘¯ ðŸ“«  I am also passionate and open to research on the subjects: DevOps, Cloud, Telecommunication, Data Analysis, African Language Numeration, Machine Learning, Low tech, Green Tech, SDN (Software Defined Network)
